## Asean Tech Digest

### 2019

Upon opening Eurazeo's Singapore office, the need to swiftly learn and connect with the Southeast Asia tech ecosystem became apparent, especially given the lack of content covering the region's diverse countries.

I aimed to create a newsletter that would not only provide news like fundraising and appointments but also offer in-depth analysis on how regions like India and China impact Southeast Asia's tech landscape.

The newsletter was designed in a biweekly format to balance timeliness with depth of content.

With 800 subscribers, the newsletter helped me source valuable dealflow and connections opportunities, leading to Eurazeo's inaugural investments in Indonesia, in Pinhome and Qoala, which I closed.
