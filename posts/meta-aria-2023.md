## AR Workshop Project: Cloth Detection Shopping App on Meta's Aria Glasses

### 2023

Fascinated by the concept of augmented vision in games like Deus Ex, I envisioned a future where such capabilities become part of our daily lives. Discovering the Aria project's advancements at Meta confirmed that we are inching closer to making this augmented reality vision a tangible experience.

Selected for a 3-day research workshop at Meta's headquarters, I aimed to develop a compelling AR application that leverages AI, focusing on creating a seamless way for people to connect with their interests through the Aria glasses.

My team and I developed a cloth detection shopping app that offers a full end-to-end user experience, integrating AR and AI for object detection and narration models. This app enables users to look at people through the glasses and, upon expressing interest in their style, combines the user's purchase history with what is seen to suggest where items can be bought.

Our innovative application was presented to the VP of Meta Reality Labs Research, showcasing the potential of combining AR with AI to enhance everyday experiences and interactions.
