## Interactive Gamified Resume

Drawing from my love for classic video games like MegaMan for the desktop version, and the stylish Tokyo 42 for mobile, I aimed to infuse my resume with the essence of these games.

I envisioned making my resume not just interactive and engaging but a creative venture that truly connects the dots between my experiences and skills.

Leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I implemented an inverted scrolling mechanism for a parallax effect and crafted handmade pixel art graphics to bring the experience to life.

The result is a unique website that allows users to navigate through my life experiences and achievements as if they were playing a platformer video game.
