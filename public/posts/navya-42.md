## Navya x 42 Autonomous Vehicle Software Engineering Challenge

### 2018

My journey in venture capital beginning in 2017 led me to explore the autonomous driving sector, revealing its promising potential early on.

Anticipating a future where work becomes mobile, my vision was set before the rise of Zoom and the emergence of digital nomads. I foresaw vehicles, specifically cabs, transforming into dynamic spaces for leaders to conduct meetings, thereby enhancing productivity. Navya was developing a new version of its autonomous cab, and looking for software engineers to integrate new use-case ideas to its vanguard product.

As the product lead, I spearheaded the development of the product strategy, roadmap, and launch features. Collaborating with a team of three software engineers, we utilized React Native, NodeJS, MongoDB, and AWS to create a user-centric autonomous cab hailing platform.

We won this 6-month challenge organized by Navya from a competitive field of 12 teams. This achievement led us to represent Navya at the 2019 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, present our solution there, and was coinciding with Navya's listing on the Euronext stock exchange that year.
