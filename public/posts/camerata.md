## The Camerata

### 2024

The Camerata was a group of Renaissance thinkers, artists, and scientists dedicated to combining arts and sciences to innovate.

Inspired from Joi, the AI companion in Blade Runner 2049, the idea was to blend advanced AI with the intimate guidance of not one but a council of personal advisors and companions, available anytime.

In this spirit, The Camerata aims to provide a digital council of AI advisors, each tailored to specific aspects of lifeâ€”be it creativity, legal advice, or philosophical inquiry.

The technical foundation was set with Next.js and Tailwind for the frontend, paired with a backend API on Google Cloud. The system is powered by LangChain and OpenAI, with Python Flask managing the interactions for each specialized advisor.
